Exercise 1

#### Part A

Create a program that declares two anonymous functions. One that counts up to 100 from 0 and one that counts down to 0 from 100. Display each number with an unique identifier for each goroutine. Then create goroutines from these functions and don't let main return until the goroutines complete.

#### Part B
Run the program in parallel.
